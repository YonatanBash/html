	<p class="pcolor1 bigfont"> <strong>Hello everyone, it's me <em><span style="background-color:black">Yonatan Bashiri</em></span> 
I'm 25 years old, from Ashdod, Married to Sapir since 1 year.<br>
4 Years ago, I was fat, really fat.
I started eating alot in the army and didn't train until I couldn't look at myself anymore.<br>
I was shy at the beach, had no self confidence.<br>
Until I decided that I must make a change, I must exercise and start eating healthy.<br>
I fell in love with the gym and decided to study "Personal Training". <br>
 Now I'm a certificated Personal Trainer from Wingate.</strong>

	Lately I've decided to take a step and get out of my "comfort zone" by starting a new career.<br>
	I always felt my career destiny is working in a computers environment.<br>
	I did my research and read about <a style="color:hotpink;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance" target="_blank">Quality Assurance.</a><br>
	As i dived deeper I found that my nature is suitable with the character requirements for being a good QA.<br>
